# Filenames

## Follow the path-centric approach rather than a filename-centric approach!

This way it's easy to search for files in large projects by simply remembering the file location rather than a unique filename,
which many times is hard to find anyways.

# Programming

## Bottom-up

[http://paulgraham.com/progbot.html](Paul Graham - Programming bottom-up)
Think about also adjusting the language to your need instead of adjusting just the program itself to fulfill its purpose.
This way your language extension might be used in other projects as well!

# Working without the mouse

## Browser

With the Vimium plugin for chrome, you'll be able to do almost everything without the mouse.

## Coding

In order to never use the mouse again, these are the application to rescue:

* tmux
* vim
  * General plugins 
    * command-t (For opening files)
  * Typescript
    * typescript-vim (Syntax highlighting)
    * tsuquyomi (IDE-like functionality)
